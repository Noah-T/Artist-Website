		<h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
		<p >My art depicts women in all the variety of their beauty. It is both sensuous and spiritual.</p>

<p>Making art for me is an ecstatic experience. I am swept away by the work and enter into another world. It is my passion and my purpose. When I am drawing and painting I feel like I am in the right place in the world for me. It's almost like I was made to do what I do.</p>

<p>The women in my paintings aren't models generally. These women come through me - without conscious thought on my part - it is as though I am the brush rather than the artist. The first time I see the woman coming through is when the painting is complete. It's as though you've received a box in the mail that you didn't order and as you open the box, it's the first time you know what is inside. I don't know where they come from. It's just one more thing about life that you just can't explain.</p>

<p>It is my hope that my art will take us back to the Garden of Eden. We live in a world of cruelty, horror, war, and awful things people do to one another. I want to take people to a place of beauty because I really think that's what we're all about. We're not about all that other stuff. I want to show people that there's something else. I don't think about that a lot but I think it's a motivation. I want to show people the place that I go to when I make the art.</p>
